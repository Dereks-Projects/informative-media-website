      <h1 class="section-title">About Informative Media</h1>
      <p class="about-mission-statement">We help people understand what matters in hospitality, food, and beverage &mdash; and why it matters.</p>
      <div class="page-content-block">
        <p class="text-center">That&rsquo;s the compass. Everything we build, every platform we launch, every piece of content we publish points back to that singular purpose. We believe the hospitality industry deserves an ecosystem of resources that respects the intelligence of its professionals and the curiosity of its enthusiasts &mdash; one that delivers genuine value, not noise. An ecosystem where the wine student, the restaurant operator, the spirits enthusiast, and the career sommelier all find something built with them in mind.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content-block">
        <p>We leverage modern technology to deliver a cutting-edge series of websites and applications that educate, engage, inform, and enlighten. Our platforms aren&rsquo;t static pages &mdash; they&rsquo;re living systems designed to evolve alongside the industries they serve.</p>
        <p>Our ecosystem is built on a foundation of technologies chosen for performance, scalability, and the ability to deliver beautiful, fast experiences on any device. We develop with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong> for dynamic, interactive applications. We use <strong>Astro</strong> for lightning-fast static sites that search engines love. Our content infrastructure runs on <strong>Sanity.io</strong>, a headless CMS that allows us to manage and distribute content across multiple platforms from a single source of truth. Our recommendation engine leverages custom application logic built in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and designed for real-time responsiveness.</p>
        <p>This isn&rsquo;t technology for the sake of technology. Every framework, every tool, every architectural decision is made in service of one thing: getting the right knowledge to the right person at the right moment. The stack is modern because the delivery needs to be. The approach is integrated because the industry demands it. And the execution is meticulous because that&rsquo;s the standard we hold ourselves to &mdash; the same standard the best restaurants and hotels in the world hold themselves to every single night.</p>

  <!-- ===== SECTION 3: FOUNDER BIO ===== -->
  <section class="section section-light">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="text-center">
        <span class="detail-card-category" style="color: var(--color-accent-dark);">The Founder</span>
        <h2 class="section-title section-title-dark about-section-heading">Derek Engles</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="founder-grid">
        <div class="founder-text">
          <p>There&rsquo;s a moment that happens in a great restaurant &mdash; somewhere between the first glass of wine and the last bite of dessert &mdash; where everything clicks. The food, the service, the conversation, the room. People lean in. They laugh a little louder. They stay a little longer. That moment is the whole point. It&rsquo;s why hospitality exists, and it&rsquo;s the reason Derek Engles has spent more than twenty years trying to help people create more of them.</p>
          <p>Derek&rsquo;s career started on the floor &mdash; not in a boardroom, not behind a screen, but in the dining room, face to face with guests, learning what it actually takes to make someone feel something. Over more than a decade as a sommelier and wine director at Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts International, he personally served more than 200,000 guests across some of the most recognized fine dining rooms in the country. He earned his Advanced Sommelier certification from the Court of Master Sommeliers. He completed Harvard Business School&rsquo;s Leadership Program. He studied the business of hospitality at every level.</p>
          <p>But what drives him has never been the credentials. It&rsquo;s the look on someone&rsquo;s face when they taste a wine that changes the way they think about wine. It&rsquo;s the server who finally understands <em>why</em> the details matter and starts taking pride in getting them right. It&rsquo;s the team that goes from good to genuinely great because someone gave them the education they deserved.</p>
          <p>That&rsquo;s what Informative Media is. It&rsquo;s Derek&rsquo;s belief &mdash; built from years of experience and carried by genuine conviction &mdash; that the world of wine, food, beverage, travel, and hospitality is one of the most beautiful and exciting things human beings do together. Sharing a meal. Discovering a new region through its wine. Sitting at a bar in a city you&rsquo;ve never been to and letting the bartender surprise you. These aren&rsquo;t small things. They&rsquo;re the moments that make life richer.</p>
          <p>Informative Media exists to help more people experience those moments &mdash; and to give the professionals who create them the knowledge and tools they need to do it at the highest level. Every platform, every article, every recommendation is built with that purpose. Not because it&rsquo;s a business strategy, but because it&rsquo;s the only thing worth building.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content-block">
        <p>We&rsquo;re not finished. The ecosystem will continue to grow &mdash; new platforms, new formats, new ways to reach the people who care about hospitality, food, beverage, and travel. We are constantly refining our existing offerings, finding new ways to penetrate markets, and expanding the boundaries of what experiential education can look like in a digital context.</p>
        <p>Our focus remains unchanged: delivering high-quality, experience-driven education alongside the beautiful, untold stories of wine, food, gastronomy, travel, and the highlights of human culture. The stories of the winemaker who bets everything on a single vintage. The chef who traces a dish back four generations. The hotel that turns a Tuesday arrival into something a guest remembers for years. These stories deserve to be told well, and the professionals who create these experiences deserve resources built with the same care they bring to their craft.</p>
        <p>This is what&rsquo;s next. More depth. More reach. More moments where someone discovers something that changes the way they see the world of hospitality &mdash; and realizes they want to be part of it.</p>
