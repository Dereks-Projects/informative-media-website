      <p class="section-text">The next generation of hospitality consumers doesn&rsquo;t live on one platform. They move between websites, apps, articles, and social &mdash; and they expect brands to meet them everywhere. A single touchpoint isn&rsquo;t a strategy. An integrated ecosystem is. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve built, and that&rsquo;s what we offer our partners.</p>

  <!-- ===== PARTNERSHIP PILLARS ===== -->
  <section class="section section-dark detail-section">
    <div class="container">

      <!-- 1: Marketing Partnership -->
      <div class="detail-card">
        <div class="detail-card-content">
          <span class="detail-card-category">Partnership</span>
          <h2 class="detail-card-title">Marketing Partnership</h2>
          <p class="detail-card-text">Our roots are in hospitality, food, and beverage &mdash; not in an ad agency. That distinction matters. When we partner with a winery, a distributor, or a hospitality organization, we bring two decades of frontline experience to the table alongside a portfolio of platforms that reach the people who actually make purchasing decisions.</p>
          <p class="detail-card-text">We don&rsquo;t run banner ads. We build integrated campaigns across our ecosystem &mdash; content, recommendations, education, and visibility &mdash; because that&rsquo;s how modern audiences engage. If your brand belongs in front of hospitality professionals and serious enthusiasts, this is how it gets there.</p>

      <!-- 2: White Label Products -->
      <div class="detail-card">
        <div class="detail-card-content">
          <span class="detail-card-category">Products</span>
          <h2 class="detail-card-title">White Label Products</h2>
          <p class="detail-card-text">Not every organization needs to build from scratch. Some need a finished product that carries their name and reflects their standards. We create bespoke digital experiences in education and marketing for the hospitality, tourism, and food &amp; beverage industries &mdash; from fully branded websites and consumer-facing applications to training platforms and development packages.</p>
          <p class="detail-card-text">The technology is ours. The brand is yours. The experience is seamless.</p>
          <a href="mailto:derekengles@gmail.com" class="btn btn-primary">Explore White Label &rarr;</a>

      <!-- 3: Educational Partnership -->
      <div class="detail-card">
        <div class="detail-card-content">
          <span class="detail-card-category">Education</span>
          <h2 class="detail-card-title">Educational Partnership</h2>
          <p class="detail-card-text">Every hospitality operator wants the same thing: a training program rigorous enough to earn Forbes Five-Star, Michelin, AAA Diamond, and La Liste recognition &mdash; but practical enough for a real team to execute on a Tuesday night. Most settle for something in between. We build the version they actually wanted.</p>
          <p class="detail-card-text">Our education programs are designed by someone who has lived the service cycle at the highest level &mdash; not theorized about it from a classroom. We specialize in developing curriculum for organizations that are pursuing accolades, maintaining them, or building cultures of service excellence that don&rsquo;t depend on a rating to justify their standards.</p>
          <a href="mailto:derekengles@gmail.com" class="btn btn-primary">Discuss Your Program &rarr;</a>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- 4: Consulting -->
      <div class="detail-card">
        <div class="detail-card-content">
          <span class="detail-card-category">Advisory</span>
          <h2 class="detail-card-title">Consulting &amp; Strategic Advisory</h2>
          <p class="detail-card-text">Sometimes an organization doesn&rsquo;t need a product. It needs perspective. Our consulting engagements are built for leadership teams navigating the intersection of hospitality operations, digital transformation, and education strategy &mdash; three domains that increasingly depend on each other and are rarely understood together.</p>
          <p class="detail-card-text">We work with executive teams to assess operational readiness, identify market positioning opportunities, and develop go-to-market strategies rooted in industry fluency rather than generic frameworks. Engagements are scoped to the outcome, not the hour.</p>
